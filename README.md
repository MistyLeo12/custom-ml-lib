# About
Currently the library is based 

# Current Algorithms
* Random Forest[^2]

* Extra Trees Algorithms

In the Extra Trees algorithm, each tree is trained using the whole learning sample and the splitting in the tree is randomized. The randomness is selected from a uniform distribution within the feature's range. From all the splits, the one with the highest score is chosen to split the node.
